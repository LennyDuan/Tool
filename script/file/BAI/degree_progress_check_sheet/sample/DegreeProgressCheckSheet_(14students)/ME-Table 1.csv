"1. This category requires:
    •  2 credits of Vg496 Professional Ethics, and 
    • 14 credits of courses in humanities, social sciences, professional development, and natural sciences. 
       At least 1 course (3 or 4 credits) in humanities and at least 1 course (3 or 4 credits) in social sciences must be
       completed. 
    Courses that may satisfy this category of requirement:
    - All VR, VX, VW, VF, and VB courses are acceptable;
    - All VZ courses are acceptable only for international students;
    - All VY courses except VY100 and VY200 are acceptable;
    - UM courses that can be used to satisfy the Intellectual Breadth requirements at CoE are acceptable;
    - SJTU courses taught in English are acceptable with approval of this committee.",,,,,,
2. International students can use Vm010 instead. ,,,,,,
"3. Fulfilled by taking VV454, VE401,VE301,VV556, VV557 or another mathematics course approved by the ME 
    Program Advisor.Any credits in excess of 3 may be applied to the Flexible Technical Elective (non-ME) or General
    Elective categories.",,,,,,
"4. a. DD program participants: fulfilled by taking courses at 300-level or higher in ME, or other engineering or sciences
         fields approved by the ME Program Advisor, excluding Ve300 and Ve496.
     b. Others: fulfilled by taking
         • Two courses (totaling at least 6 credits) must be 300-level or higher in ME. One of the two courses (at least 3 credits)
            must be 400-level or higher.
         • Any 300-level or higher courses in ME or in other engineering, biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics fields,
           excluding Ve300 and Ve496. 
      Up to 3 credits of courses taken from other engineering or science departments of SJTU may be counted in this
      category but must be 300-leverl or higher. These courses must be approved by the ME Program Advisor. 
      Any credits in excess of 11 may be applied to the General Elective category.",,,,,,
