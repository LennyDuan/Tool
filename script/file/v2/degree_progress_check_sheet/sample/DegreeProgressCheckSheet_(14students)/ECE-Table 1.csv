    - All VZ courses are acceptable only for international students;
    - All VY courses except VY100 and VY200 are acceptable;
    - UM courses that can be used to satisfy the Intellectual Breadth requirements at CoE are acceptable;
    - SJTU courses taught in English are acceptable with approval of this committee.",,,,,,
"2. A minimum of 4 credits from one of the following categories:
    • Circuits: Ve312 
    • Computers: Ve281, Ve373
    • Electromagnetics/Optics: Ve330, Ve334   
    • Signals and systems: Ve353, Ve451, Ve455, Ve460                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
    The Undergraduate Education Office keeps a list of courses offered at JI towards this category.
    Additional courses may be acceptable, but must be approved by the JI Undergraduate Committee.
